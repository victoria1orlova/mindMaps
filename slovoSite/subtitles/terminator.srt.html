This next patient is interesting.</br>
I've been following</br>
the case for years.</br>
A 29-year-old female,</br>
diagnosed as acute</br>
schizo-affective disorder.</br>
The usual indicators:</br>
depression, anxiety,</br>
violent acting out,</br>
delusions of persecution.</br>
The delusional architecture</br>
is fairly unique.</br>
She believes that a machine</br>
called the Terminator,</br>
which looked human, of course,</br>
was sent back through time </br>
to kill her.</br>
That's original.</br>
And also,</br>
that the father of her child</br>
was a soldier</br>
sent back to protect her.</br>
- No?</br>
- He was from the future too.</br>
The year 2029,</br>
if I remember correctly.</br>
And here we are.</br>

Good morning, Dr Silberman.</br>

who's responsible.</br>
The man most directly responsible is </br>
Miles Bennett Dyson.</br>
<b><font color="#804000">JOHN:</font></b> Who is that?</br>
He's the director of special projects</br>
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.</br>
Why him?</br>
In a few months he creates</br>
a revolutionary type</br>
of microprocessor.</br>
- Go on. Then what?</br>
- In three years,</br>
Cyberdyne will become</br>
the largest supplier</br>
of military computer systems.</br>
All Stealth bombers are upgraded</br>
with Cyberdyne computers,</br>
becoming fully unmanned.</br>
Afterwards, they fly with</br>
a perfect operational record.</br>
The Skynet Funding bill is passed.</br>
The system goes on-line</br>
on August 4, 1997.</br>
Human decisions are removed</br>
from strategic defence.</br>
Skynet begins to learn</br>
at a geometric rate.</br>
It becomes self-aware at 02:14 am</br>
Eastern time, August 29.</br>
In a panic,</br>
they try to pull the plug.</br>
- Skynet fights back.</br>
- Yes.</br>
It launches its missiles</br>
against the targets in Russia.</br>
Why attack Russia?</br>
Aren't they our friends now?</br>
Because Skynet knows that</br>
the Russian counterattack</br>
will eliminate </br>
its enemies over here.</br>
